I created this repository just to test out [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) &
see if I can do something cool with it. This code is licensed under the MIT
license. Feel free to do whatever you want with the code. You can find a copy
of the license in the [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) file. 🖤

### Todo

- [x] Setup the repo & the project.
- [x] Play with basic rendering & shapes.
- [x] Write convey's game of life! My first cellular automaton that is also turing complete! : )
